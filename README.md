# promptbox-android

`promptbox` is an Android SDK that caches AI prompts and responses based on semantic similarity, not just exact matches.

Instead of matching prompts exactly, it uses embeddings and cosine similarity to figure out if the user is basically asking the same thing. That way, you can skip unnecessary calls to your AI backend and serve faster, cheaper, cached responses.

Still a work in progress.
