# promptbox-android

`promptbox` is an Android SDK for caching AI prompts and responses â€” but with a twist.

Instead of matching prompts exactly, it uses embeddings and cosine similarity to figure out if the user is basically asking the same thing. That way, you can skip unnecessary calls to your AI backend and serve faster, cheaper, cached responses.

Still a work in progress.
